# Pytest Configuration File
# =========================
# This file configures the pytest testing framework for the Pemo application
# test suite. It defines test discovery patterns, execution options,
# and environment-specific configurations.
#
# Configuration Sections:
# - [tool:pytest]: Main pytest configuration options
# - markers: Custom test markers for categorization
# - env: Environment-specific variable settings

[tool:pytest]
# Test Discovery Configuration
# ===========================
# Define where pytest should look for test files and how to identify them
testpaths = tests                                    # Directory containing test files
python_files = test_*.py                             # Test file naming pattern
python_classes = Test*                               # Test class naming pattern
python_functions = test_*                            # Test function naming pattern

# Test Execution Options
# ======================
# Configure how pytest runs tests and displays output
addopts = 
    -v                                               # Verbose output showing each test
    -s                                               # Show print statements during test execution
    --tb=short                                       # Short traceback format for failures
    --strict-markers                                 # Enforce marker validation
    --disable-warnings                               # Suppress warning messages during execution

# Custom Test Markers
# ===================
# Define custom markers for categorizing and filtering tests
# These markers can be used to run specific test subsets
markers =
    dev: marks tests for development environment       # Development environment tests
    staging: marks tests for staging environment      # Staging environment tests
    prod: marks tests for production environment      # Production environment tests
    slow: marks tests as slow                        # Tests that take longer to execute
    integration: marks tests as integration tests     # End-to-end integration tests

# Environment-Specific Configurations
# ===================================
# Set environment variables based on test markers
# This allows tests to adapt to different deployment environments
env =
    dev: TEST_ENV=dev                               # Development environment variable
    staging: TEST_ENV=staging                       # Staging environment variable
    prod: TEST_ENV=prod                            # Production environment variable
