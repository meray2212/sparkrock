def test_bulk_invite_members():
    """
    Test for bulk invitation of multiple team members via CSV upload.
    
    This test validates the bulk invitation functionality including:
    - User authentication and login
    - Navigation to team management section
    - Bulk invite interface access
    - CSV file upload and processing
    - Member invitation validation
    - Role assignment verification
    
    The test uses the Page Object Model pattern and generates
    random test email addresses for each execution.
    
    Test Steps:
    1. Authenticate user with OTP verification
    2. Navigate to Members & Teams section
    3. Open bulk invite interface and switch to CSV tab
    4. Generate and upload CSV file with test emails
    5. Validate that invited members appear with correct roles
    6. Verify invitation status for each member
    
    Note:
        This test requires valid admin credentials and assumes the
        user has permissions to invite team members. It generates
        temporary CSV files that are automatically cleaned up.

        # =====================================

        # =======================================

        # This validates both the invitation process and role assignment
        
        # Validate first invited member
        # Verify they appear with "Team Member" role and "Invite sent" status

        # Validate second invited member
        # Verify they also appear with "Team Member" role and "Invite sent" status
